# 🌐 Web Scraping Automation 🚀

Welcome to the Web Scraping Automation project! This project harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and automation to scrape financial articles and analyze them like never before.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to automate the web scraping of financial articles using cutting-edge NLP techniques, specifically the Attention Mechanism in transformer models. By combining various powerful technologies, this project aims to deliver insightful analysis with speed and accuracy.

## 💻 Technologies Utilized

This project stands on the shoulders of some amazing tools and libraries:

- 🤖 **Transformer Library**: At the core of our NLP magic, this library helps implement transformer-based techniques for article analysis.
- 📊 **Hugging Face's Evaluate Library**: Ensures our NLP models are performing at their best with precise evaluation metrics.
- 🕸️ **Selenium & BeautifulSoup**: Dynamic duo for web automation (Selenium) and web scraping (BeautifulSoup) to gather financial articles from the web.
- 🔥 **PyTorch**: Handles dataset preparation and model fine-tuning to bring out the best from our transformer model.
- 🚀 **FastAPI & Uvicorn Server**: Powers the deployment of our NLP model via an API, so it's easy to integrate and use across applications.
- 🌍 **MERN Stack**: The user-friendly web interface is built using the MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js stack. It allows users to explore and interact with scraped financial articles visually.
