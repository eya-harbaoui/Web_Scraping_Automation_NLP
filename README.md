# Web Scraping Automation
# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to automate the process of web scraping for financial articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This automation makes use of the Attention Mechanism present in transformer models, and it encompasses a range of technologies to achieve its objectives.

# Technologies Utilized
The following technologies are employed in this project:

Transformer Library: The project utilizes the Transformer library, which is pivotal for implementing transformer-based NLP techniques.

Hugging Face's Evaluate Library: This library from Hugging Face is used for evaluation purposes, ensuring the effectiveness of our NLP models.

Selenium and BeautifulSoup: Selenium is used for web automation, while BeautifulSoup facilitates web scraping. Together, they enable the collection of financial articles from various websites.

PyTorch: PyTorch is employed for dataset preparation and model fine-tuning, ensuring that the NLP model performs optimally for the task.

FastAPI and Uvicorn Server: These technologies are used for deploying the NLP model, making it accessible via an API for integration into various applications.

MERN Stack: The project includes a web interface created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This interface allows users to visualize and interact with the scraped financial article data.
